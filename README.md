IMDB-Crawler
============

Python Crawler for IMDB website. 

The code builds a small knowledge base about top N movies listed at http://www.imdb.com/chart/top.
The knowledge base will store the case of each of the N Movies. The knowledge base is built during the runtime and stored in a python dictionary.
Given the name of a cast member, the program will be able to return the movies out of the top "N" movies he/she has acted in. "N" will be passed by
the user. 


Run the code using following command:

```
python crawler.py
```
